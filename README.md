Hi. I have full experience about blockchain and very good at smart contract & crypto wallet. I have already developed Dapp , Defi , WAX , DEX  and so on.I can do completely.
I am also a P2E game/DEX developer on WAX chain.
I have built several kinds of P2E game and DEX projects on Wax and Ethereum.
I wrote a contract that allows users to claim various types of tokens by date or time according to the results obtained by game mechnizm by staking card packs NFTs purchased from automic into the client's App, and integrated the contract with the frontend.
In addition, when building P2E games such as scotland yard board game, AI Bot was introduced as a smart contract developer to develop a reward system in which tokens are rewarded according to the match result between one player and the AI bot.
I am very familiar with token generation with tokennomics and wrote game logic and architecture to increase the value of the generated token.
In addition, we developed a smart contract and Frontend that can propose and create NFTs that can be traded in this project using the NFTs that are standardly created in the simple assets protocol in NFTDEX.
He has accumulated a lot of experience in several P2E game projects and DEX projects.
Waiting for your kindly reply.
Thanks.
